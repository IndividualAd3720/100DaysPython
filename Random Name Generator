# This is my code

# You are working in a team of developers.
# Another developer has written the code to import the names in the inputs
# You can run the code to see what this names list looks like.
# Then change the names in the input to see how it imports the names.
# print(names)
# ðŸš¨ Remember to remove the print statement above when you submit.
